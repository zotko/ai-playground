An overview of the Gemini app
We have long seen the potential of AI to make information and computing more accessible and useful to people. We have made pioneering advances on large language models (LLMs) and have seen great progress across Google and in this field more broadly. For several years, we have applied LLMs in the background to improve many of our products, such as autocompleting sentences in Gmail, expanding Google Translate, and helping us better understand queries in Google Search. We continue using LLMs for many Google services, as well as to power the Gemini app, which allows people to collaborate directly with generative AI. We want the Gemini app to be the most helpful and personal AI assistant, giving users direct access to Google’s latest AI models.

While we’re at an important inflection point and encouraged by the widespread excitement around generative AI, it’s still early days for this technology. This explainer outlines how we’re approaching our work on the Gemini app (“Gemini”), including its mobile and web experiences — what it is, how it works and its current capabilities and limitations. Our approach to building Gemini will evolve as its underlying technology evolves, and as we learn from ongoing research, experience and user feedback.

What Gemini is
Gemini is an interface to a multimodal LLM (handling text, audio, images and more). Gemini is based on Google’s cutting-edge research in LLMs, which began with the Word2Vec paper in 2013 that proposed novel model architectures that mapped words as mathematical concepts, followed by the introduction of a neural conversational model in 2015. This framework demonstrated how models could predict the next sentence in a conversation based on the previous sentence or sentences, leading to more natural conversational experiences. This was followed by our breakthrough work on Transformer in 2017 and multi-turn chat capabilities in 2020, which demonstrated even more compelling generative language progress.

We initially launched Gemini (then called Bard) as an experiment in March 2023 in accordance with our AI Principles. Since then, users have turned to Gemini to write compelling emails, debug tricky coding problems, brainstorm ideas for upcoming events, get help learning difficult concepts, and so much more. Today, Gemini is a versatile AI tool that can help you in many ways. We already see Gemini helping people be more productive, more creative, and more curious and we add new functionality and innovations regularly.

Productivity
For starters, Gemini can save you time. For example, say you are looking to summarize a long research document; Gemini lets you upload it and gives you a useful synthesis. Gemini can also help with coding tasks, and coding has quickly become one of its most popular applications.

Creativity
Gemini can also help bring your ideas to life and spark your creativity. For example, if you’re writing a blog post, Gemini can create an outline and generate images that help illustrate your post. And coming soon with Gems, you will be able to customize Gemini with specific instructions and have it act as a subject matter expert to help you accomplish your personal goals.

Curiosity
Gemini can be a jumping off point for exploring your ideas and things you’d like to learn more about. For instance, it can explain a complex concept simply or surface relevant insights on a topic or image. And soon, it will pair these insights with recommended content from across the web to learn more about specific topics.

Gemini's capabilities are rapidly expanding -- soon, you’ll be able to point your phone’s camera at an object, say, for example, the Golden Gate bridge and ask Gemini to tell you about its paint color (if you’re wondering, it’s “International Orange”). You’ll also be able to ask Gemini to help you navigate a restaurant’s menu in another language and recommend a dish you’re likely to enjoy. These are just two examples of the new capabilities coming soon to Gemini.

Of course we rigorously train and monitor Gemini so that its responses are likely to be reliable and aligned with your expectations. We also talk with industry experts, educators, policymakers, business leaders, civil and human rights leaders, and content creators to explore new applications, risks, and limitations of this emerging technology.
